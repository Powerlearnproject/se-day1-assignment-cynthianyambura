#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry ?

Software engineering applies the principle of engineering to the systematic design, development, test, deployment, and maintenance of high quality software systems by applying engineering principles, methods and tools.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering ?

1.The introduction of structured programming
2. The development of the Waterfall model
3. The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle ?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software engineers to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It consists of several phases, Each phase ensures that the software is developed systematically and meets user needs.
It consists of the following phases: 
1.  Planning- defining project scope and feasibility.
2. Analysis- (gathering and analyzing requirements. 
3.  Design- creating the system's architecture. 
4. Implementation- coding the software. 
5. Testing- identifying and fixing issues.
6. Deployment- releasing the software to users.
7. Maintenance- ongoing updates and support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate ?

Waterfall is a linear, sequential software development process wherein each phase, starting from requirement to design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance, is completed before the next phase begins. It's rigid and hence appropriate for projects with stable, well-defined requirements. while Agile is an iterative and incremental development approach, so it may allow flexibility and frequent change during development; hence, it is suitable for projects with evolving requirements. In the Waterfall model, comprehensive documentation has priority over working software, but in Agile, working software and rapid delivery are emphasized. Therefore, the choice depends on the flexibility required by the project and the certainty of its requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team ?

1. Software Developers in a software engineering team design, code, and maintain software while working with other team members and documenting the work. 
2. QA Engineers ensure the quality of the software by testing and validating it; this is usually done by automating tests and keeping track of bugs. 
3. Project Managers take care of project planning, handling resources, and communication with all stakeholders to ensure the timely completion of projects within the scope and budget. Each role helps in delivering high-quality software products.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each ?

1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
These are software applications that provide an extended set of facilities to computer programmers for developing software. An IDE includes mainly an :
-Code Editor, This facilitates syntax highlighting along with completion facilities. Compiler/Interpreter, The facility to compile/interpret code directly from the IDE. Debugger, The facility to debug the code by setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and running the control flow details. Integrated Tools, Integration with build systems, version control systems, and other tools for the sake of easing a development process.
-IDEs organize all of the vital development instruments in a single space. This means there is no need to switch from one application to another. Some IDEs fully provide collaborative coding, where several developers can concurrently work on the same code.
2. VCS are tools that help manage changes to source code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
-Importance: Collaboration, VCS enables teams to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, merging changes systematically.
History Tracking, VCS maintains a history of all changes made to the codebase, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently, merging them back into the main codebase when ready.
-Backup and Recovery: With VCS, code is stored in a central repository, protecting against data loss and enabling recovery of previous versions.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges ?

1. Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Advancements
Dedicate time for regular learning. Subscribe to tech blogs, attend webinars, and take online courses. Try new technologies and frameworks to stay hands-on. Connect with other engineers to share knowledge and experiences.
2. Meeting Tight Deadlines
Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique to improve focus and productivity. Identify and tackle the most critical tasks first. Utilize tools and scripts to streamline repetitive tasks.
3. Dealing with Ambiguous or Changing Requirements
Ensure a shared understanding of requirements with stakeholders. Be adaptable to changes and willing to iterate on solutions. Use tools like Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
4. Managing Technical Debt
Periodically improve code quality and maintainability. Address high-risk technical debt first. Maintain clear documentation to prevent future misunderstandings.
5. Balancing Work and Personal Life
Establish clear work-life boundaries. Prioritize tasks and allocate time for personal activities. Take care of your physical and mental health.
6. Team Collaboration and Communication
Use clear and concise language, both written and verbal. Schedule regular meetings to discuss progress and address issues. Develop skills to resolve conflicts constructively.
7. Dealing with Imposter Syndrome
Focus on achievements by recognizing and celebrate your accomplishments. Talk to mentors or colleagues about your feelings. Keep improving your skills to boost confidence.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. UNIT SETTING : Purpose- The testing of individual components or units of code in isolation from each other.
Importance:
i.  The process detects and resolves defects early in the cycle of development.
ii. Improves code maintainability and reusability.
iii. It provides a safety net for future code changes.
2. INTEGRATION SETTING:Purpose -Testing of interaction between different components or modules of the software using black box testing.
Importance:
i. Ensures components will play well together.
ii. It discovers issues with the interface and data flow.
iii. Helps in validating the overall design of the system.
3. SYSTEM SETTING :Purpose -Covers the examination of the whole system for specified requirements.
Importance:
i. Ensures that software meets the needs and expectations of users.
ii. It identifies defects that only come to the fore when the system is tested as a whole.
iii. This ensures performance, scalability, and security of the system.
4. ACCEPTANCE SETTING:Purpose -The software will be acceptable to end-users or stakeholders.
Importance:
i. Checks whether the software meets all the business requirements and satisfies the user's expectations.
ii. It provides the last quality check before deployment.
iii. It helps in gaining stakeholders' approval and confidence.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models ?

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models like large language models (LLMs) to get preffered outputs. It involves understanding the model's competence, limitations, and biases.
Importance:
1. Clearness and Specificity: The prompt must be clear, concise, and highly specific to prevent ambiguity.
2. Contextual Information: Support with associated context that will help the AI understand what the query is and lead to delivering appropriate responses.
Instructional Phrasing Use instructional phrasing: "Write a poem about.", "Explain in layman's terms." to orient how the AI will respond
3. Alert Biasing : Awareness around potential biases in the model you are using and thus forming prompts to not encourage those biases
 Experiment with different prompt types and prompt variations to see what might work the best for the experiment.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective ?
